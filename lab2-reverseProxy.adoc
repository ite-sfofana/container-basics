= More on Docker (Multi-staging)

In this lab we are using a multi-stage build to a reverse proxy in front of a backend App.
For that we are using the repo of pmckeetx.
....
$ git clone https://github.com/pmckeetx/docker-nginx.git
....

Change directory to the docker-nginx and explore the Dockerfile.

```
# Build the react.js app as backend
FROM node:12.18.2 as build

ARG REACT_APP_SERVICES_HOST=/services/m

WORKDIR /app

COPY ./package.json /app/package.json
COPY ./package-lock.json /app/package-lock.json

RUN yarn install
COPY . .
RUN yarn build

# Build the frontend app 
FROM nginx
COPY ./nginx/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
```
Now explore the configuration of the reverse-proxy.

```
server { 
 listen 80;
 server_name frontend;
 location / {
   # This would be the directory where your React app's static files are stored at
   root /usr/share/nginx/html;
   try_files $uri /index.html;
 }
 
 location /services/m {
   proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
   proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
   proxy_set_header X-NginX-Proxy true;
   proxy_pass http://backend:8080/services/m;
   proxy_ssl_session_reuse off;
   proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
   proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
   proxy_redirect off;
 }
}
```
Now we can start the applications by firing the bellow command.
....
$ docker-compose -up
....
